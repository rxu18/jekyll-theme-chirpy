This came about through a series of somewhat unrelated decisions.</p><ol><li>Around summer 2019, I realized that there are lots of good CS courses I want to take. I also found out that concurrent masters exists and seems to be a good deal. So, I decided to go for CS masters starting with CS 223.<li>I also wanted to take lots of math courses after math 55, and chose to be a math major.<li>I only became joint Math/Stat in Summer 2021, because of my senior thesis.</ol><p>I decided on the steps above following an advice from Ross (who received it from Harry Lewis), and want to copy it here:</p><ul><li>Pick the 32 courses you most want to take.<li>See if any major will give you a degree for exactly those.<li>If so, then you’re done.<li>If not, find the one that will give you a degree with the fewest changes. Pick that one.</ul><p>While you see lots of 6-class semester, not generally recommended. - Have extra time thanks to being home, - Have classes that</p><h2 id="6-course-semesters">6-course semesters</h2><p>Overall, I do <em>not</em> recommend taking 6 courses in a semester. This is much more a “do as I say, not as I do” situation. Hear me out.</p><p>In an in-person semester there are lots of activities you can do: going to talks, traveling with friends, running events, etc. These activities are both fun and educational. Taking 6 courses usually means that you will have little free time for any of these activities, and you will miss out on college experiences as a result. I learned this the hard way during Sophomore fall. No matter how amazing the 6 courses I chose are, I am exhausted at the end of the day. I remember vividly when I sit in the dining hall with my dinner, and feel like I have no energy to talk to any of my friends there. It was a lonely feeling.</p><p>It makes sense to do this in a remote semester, where there are fewer activities. However, I do not recommend this during in-person times. If you do it, you should have some <em>very</em> easy classes. By that, I mean a class that you do not stress about once in the whole semester. For example, you can take a class you have self-studied for, or take a class SAT/UNSAT.</p><h1 id="fall-2018">Fall 2018</h1><p>For each class, I wrote a <em>spiciness</em> rating next to it. This roughly measures how tough <em>I</em> found the class when I took it. A 1-chili class include some seminars and gems, while Math 55 was a 4-chili class.</p><p><strong>Math 55a, Studies in Algebra.</strong> Joe Harris, 4 chili.</p><ul><li>This is the best math class I had.<li>I came into Harvard unsure whether I can do math. I had a certain image of a mathematician being either super intense or very antisocial. Joe showed me that a “normal” person can do math as well.<li><p>To paraphrase Pixar’s Ratatouille, “not everyone can become a great mathematician, but a great mathematician can come from anywhere”.</p><li>Math 55 is a famous course, but the course has changed significantly in the past few years. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_55">the Wikipedia</a> is rather outdated. In particular, I spent around 7-8 hours/wk.<li><p>The material itself is an in-depth overview of Linear Algebra and Group Theory.</p><li>It is great having an established mathematician teach the course, as you get to see a glimpse of modern mathematics.<li>I enjoyed Joe’s teaching style, which is why I took 2 more classes with him.</ul><p><strong>CS 121, Introduction to Theoretical CS.</strong> Boaz Barak, 2.5 chili.</p><ul><li>The material is very interesting. Thinking about TMs and reductions have helped me become a better coder in general.<li>Boaz is a good lecturer and gives lots of insights into unsolved questions in the field.<li>He is also an awesome person, which is why I took 2 more classes with him.</ul><p><strong>FSM, Predictions.</strong> Alyssa Goodman, 1 chili.</p><ul><li>Freshman seminars are a great way to explore something new. I wish I had chosen something farther away from my existing interest.<li>That said, Alyssa Goodman is awesome.<li>The course showed us cutting-edge projects and amazing visualizations, and was a good time.</ul><p><strong>USW 35, American Education.</strong> Kay Merseth, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>There are 2 gen ed’s that I would recommend to <em>any</em> Harvard student: Justice, and this course.<li>It’s also a great freshman-year course, as the occasional “challenges” get you to explore the campus and explore Boston.<li>The course gets you to reflect on the K-12 education experience. In many ways, it’s like fish learning “what is water”.</ul><h1 id="spring-2019">Spring 2019</h1><p><strong>Math 55b, Studies in Topology and Analysis.</strong> Joe Harris, 3.5 chili.</p><ul><li>Continuation of Math 55a. Great as always.<li>55b is slightly easier, mostly because moderately hard topology problems are harder to write.<li>My year did not feature real analysis, which is a small bummer. In return, we had a strong overview of Complex Analysis. Looking back, that was quite valuable.</ul><p><strong>CS 124, Introduction to Algorithms.</strong> Jelani Nelson, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>I had some algorithm background before college, which made the course a lot easier.<li>Jelani did a great job going through the material, and the programming assignments were interesting.<li>I thought the resources and support in the course was somewhat lacking, but was not affected by it.</ul><p><strong>Stat 111, Statistical Inference.</strong> Joe Blitzstein and Susan Murphy, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>This was the first year Joe taught the course, so the material was rough on the edges.<li>Also note that I skipped Stat 110. The idea was “I can self-study this by watching lectures online”. This turned out to be a terrible idea as I did not have a solid grasp of probability going in.<li>I had a lot more trouble with the material as a result. However, the struggle ended up helping me make friends from the class.</ul><p><strong>FSM, Problem of Evil.</strong> Courtney Lamberth, 1 chili.</p><ul><li>The goal is to choose something very far from my interests, and it worked out.<li>The readings were philosophical texts and rather difficult.<li>The discussions were engaging enough to make this a good course.</ul><p><strong>Expos 20, Writing on Nature.</strong> Martin Greenup, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>Writing is a lot easier when you have something to say. However, the texts chosen in the course are so non-engaging that I often have nothing to say.<li>I also found that it is a course where having a friend makes you more responsible. If I were to do it again, I would try to get my friend to be in the same Expos section as me.</ul><h1 id="fall-2019">Fall 2019</h1><p>I worked at a tech company during summer 2019. During that time, I built a model that scrapes the Q Guide and finds the best courses. The courses ended up being so interesting that I was compelled to take 6 courses simultaneously. It was tough. Looking back, however, the courses were legendary.</p><p><strong>CS 61, Introduction to Systems Programming.</strong> Eddie Kohler and Mike Smith, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>This is the <em>best</em> intro CS course at Harvard.<li>The course teaches you how a computer works at a high level, and that knowledge is quite valuable.<li>This was also our “blocking group course”, and I had a great time working with my roommates on the labs.<li>Eddie Kohler was a great lecturer, and you should consider taking courses with them.</ul><p><strong>CS 136, Introduction to EconCS.</strong> David Parkes, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>David Parkes is an amazing lecturer and explains the concepts of the course very well. Take any class with him.<li>This course is amazing. It was the highest rated course in my model, and did not disappoint.<li>The course comes in 3 parts: Game Theory, Incentives, and Modern Technology. Each part is interesting in its own right, and you get to see how theory and practice connects.<li>I would recommend this to anyone who likes <em>either</em> Econ or CS.</ul><p><strong>CS 223, Randomized Algorithms.</strong> Michael Mitzenmacher, 3.5 chili.</p><ul><li>This was a reasonable mix of Stat 110 and CS 124, with some difficult homework problems.<li>Few people show up to class, so you get good interaction with the professor when you do.</ul><p><strong>Ec 1011a, Quantitative Intro to Microeconomics.</strong> Ed Glaeser, 2.5 chili.</p><ul><li>This course features a <em>legendary</em> introduction to economics that is muddled by 30 pages of differentiation.<li>“The world is your oyster. Go and model it.” If you can see the methods behind the algebra, the models in class give insights into many different phenomena in the world. I especially enjoyed the city lectures and the moral hazard lecture.<ul><li>If you cannot, however, the algebra will eclipse everything else in the course.</ul></ul><p><strong>Ec 2099, Market Design.</strong> Scott Kominers, 2.5 chili.</p><ul><li>This course was my highlight every Tuesday. If you know any math/CS, <em>take it</em>.<li>This is a rare course that teaches you how to read papers critically. What is the author trying to express? How good is the paper? How do we know? I think these are important skills for any academic to have.<li>Scott is brilliant. His lectures are engaging, fun, with the right level of humor.<li>And, one more thing: the course has some incredible guest speakers and even more tips about how to do research. Scott was teaching us how to be a good researcher, and that is incredible.</ul><p><strong>Stat 210, Probability 2.</strong> Joe Blitzstein, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>Having survived Stat 111, I had the background to take this class :)<li>This class is magical. Much of thework with distributions feel magical, and so do the proofs using continuous time embeddings.<li>It is not an easy course, however, and I spent quite a bit on time on homeworks and exam preparations.</ul><h1 id="spring-2020">Spring 2020</h1><p>This is the start-of-COVID semester. The first month of classes was a lot of fun, but the next two months were all chaos.</p><p><strong>CS 161, Operating Systems.</strong> James Mickens, 4.5 chili.</p><ul><li>This is a class that requires dedication. It is a difficult class. Respect that.<li>The assignments were quite cool, but the main lesson they taught me is in debugging highly difficult bugs. This is a skill rarely taught in courses, and quite useful in industry.<li>Mickens’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15RTC22Z2xI">lectures</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnBfGCUORK8">are</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF24WHumvIc">very</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDwUJa4_IJE">funny</a>. You have to listen to this man speak.<li>At the same time, we covered so much material each class that much of it were “magical” in the confusing way.</ul><p><strong>CS 227, Cryptography.</strong> Boaz Barak, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>This is a course on modern cryptography: cutting edge research in theory and practice.<li>Modern cryptography is <em>very</em> different from classical codebreaking. It features far more proofs and mathematics.<li>The style of proofs can be hard to get used to, but things get smoother once you do.<li>There’s something special about having an expert in the field talk about their research, and <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/Papers/obfuscate.pdf">Boaz</a> is an expert.</ul><p><strong>Math 123, Algebra 2.</strong> Sebastien Vesey, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>The material covered in the course – rings, modules and field extensions – are useful for future mathematics.<li>That being said, I don’t remember much from the course. The COVID disruption hit math courses especially hard, and I felt that I do not have a “strong” understanding of the material here compared to those in 55.</ul><p><strong>Math 137, Algebraic Geometry.</strong> Brooke Ullery, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>The course was difficult, as it tackles some challenging algebra.<li>The parts of the course pre-COVID were quite engaging, but I don’t remember what happened after.</ul><p><strong>Gened 1149, Hebrew Bible.</strong> Shaye Cohen, 1 chili.</p><ul><li>This course is a gem, and it wears that on its sleeves.<li>Prof. Cohen is quite fun to interact with, and few enough people speak up in the course that there are many opportunities for interaction.<li>As someone who did not know much about Judaism and Christianity, this course taught me lots.<li>It also helped me reflect on my own faith, which was quite awesome.</ul><p><strong>English 131P, Paradise Lost.</strong> Gordon Teskey, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>This course was quite magical. I go to lecture and hear Prof. Teskey talk about connections and references that I did not see in the book. Then, I re-read the chapter, and see that these references were there all along.<li>That experience taught me to read books a little more closely than before, and that is quite awesome.</ul><h1 id="fall-2020">Fall 2020</h1><p>Being a remote semester, I decided to continue the 6-course workload with my extra free time.</p><p><strong>6.854, Advanced Algorithms.</strong> David Karger, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>This is my favorite algorithms course.<li>The course covers challenging material, from splay trees to computational geometry. It teaches the cutting-edge from 1990s, and the final project asks to examine the cutting edge in the 2010s.<li>Prof. Karger has an amazing way of going over the material. He motivates the algorithms through carefully crafted metaphors, and asks questions at just the right time.<li>I don’t think there’s anyone who can teach the material better than him. If there is, I would love to meet him/her.<li>However, I want to note that the class experience is a <em>lot</em> better when someone asks questions. Be brave, and ask them.</ul><p><strong>CS 263, Systems Security.</strong> James Mickens, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>Similar to 161: funnny but sometimes mysterious lectures, and somewhat difficult programming assignments.<li>The material itself was even more cool than 161, as they cover modern technology and modern attacks.<li>A good chunk of the class is based on readings, which I found difficult to stay on top of in a remote world.</ul><p><strong>Gened 1171, Justice.</strong> Michael Sandel, 1.5 chili.</p><ul><li>Like USW 35, this class is an amazing Gen Ed.<li>This is as good as the YouTube series, esp. if you are brave enough to speak up in class!<li>It is a course that gets you to reflect on ethics and morality. It does not provide a perscriptive answer, which is expected. However, I learned to think deeper about these topics. That is quite meaningful.</ul><p><strong>Math 116, Analysis and Optimization.</strong> Paul Bamberg, 1.5 chili.</p><ul><li>I don’t remember much from this course. It was not partcularly difficult given my background, but I also didn’t take much away from it.</ul><p><strong>Math 231a, Algebraic Topology.</strong> Joe Harris, 2.5 chili.</p><ul><li>Algebraic topology is quite exciting: it is a success story in mathematics, and connects much of undergrdauate math.<li>Joe’s exposition is great as always.<li>I always wondered what “cohomology” is since HS, and I finally knew!<li>At the same time, I felt that the homeworks did not test the material deep enough. This has been a trend in classes on geometry. I always hoped that I could get a deeper understanding through harder homeworks, but perhaps that is part of the situation.</ul><p><strong>Stat 333, Individual Risk.</strong> Joe Blitzstein and Cynthia Dwork, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>This class had the best staff-to-student ratio out of every class I took: half of the “students” are postdocs or professors.<li>It covers some difficult papers, on the line of being philosophical.<li>I left with more questions than answers, but enjoyed the many discussions I had during the course.</ul><h1 id="spring-2021">Spring 2021</h1><p><strong>CS 221, Complexity Theory.</strong> Madhu Sudan, 2.5 chili.</p><ul><li>If you enjoyed 121, this is a great follow up course.<li>Madhu is an expert in complexity theory, and it is always interesting to hear his perspectives on the material.<li>The final project was a lot of fun and takes you to modern day research.<li>I felt that the homework policy was perhaps overly relaxed, and wish I had spent more time on the homeworks.</ul><p><strong>CS 181, Intro to ML.</strong> David Parkes and Finale Doshi-Valez, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>This is a solid introduction to ML. David and Finale gave clear lectures, and I felt that I finally “get” what ML is about.<li>The homeworks were a little finicky, but there is usually enough support to fix the issues quickly.<li>The course is also best done with friends. I am glad that I had many friends taking it with me.</ul><p><strong>Bonus: CS 229, Seminar on ML theory.</strong> Boaz Barak.</p><ul><li>This is a graduate seminar on ML theory. I was initially nervous about the homework assignments, and decided not to take it for credit.<li>The material ended up being so interesting that I stuck around to hear all of it.<li>The course is an overview of the state of modern ML: what we know, what we don’t know, and what challenges we face. The guest speakers were amazing too.<li>If you are curious about the material, read <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/">the blog</a>!</ul><p><strong>Phil 140, Logic.</strong> Hugh Woodin, 1.5 chili.</p><ul><li>I don’t remember much from this course. It was not partcularly difficult given my background, but I also didn’t take much away from it.<li>The course material is interesting: we build a system of logic from scratch, using models and structures. I thought the course could have gone faster in the beginning, and wish we saw Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem as well.</ul><p><strong>Math 132, Differential Topology.</strong> Joe Harris, 2 chili.</p><ul><li>This is a solid introduction to differential topology, and Joe is great as always.<li>I also benefitted from having a brilliant pset partner, which made the course a lot simpler.</ul><p><strong>Math 219, From Conformal Invariance to Percolation.</strong> Curt McMullen, 3 chili.</p><ul><li>This is my favorite course from this semester.<li>It is special seeing an expert in the field talk about their work. In this case, Prof. McMullen is that expert. He has incredible intuitions about complex analysis. Because of that, his proofs are succint and elegant.<li>In addition to the special topics, I felt that I have a stronger foundation in complex analysis. That helped me teach Math 55b better.<li>This course also gave me a thesis topic that I am enjoying.</ul><p><strong>Gened 1027, Human Evolution and Human Health.</strong> Daniel Lieberman, 1.5 chili.</p><ul><li>The material itself is interesting. THe best way to describe it would be <em>Sapiens</em> but with less history and more biology.<li>The class was perhaps too attendance based for a covid-era class.<li>I would also recommend having a biology background before taking the course, as biology comes up quite often in this course.</ul></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/harvard/'>Harvard</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/harvard/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >harvard</a> <a href="/tags/classes/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >classes</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Personal opinions on Harvard courses - Wander&url=/posts/harvard-classes/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Personal opinions on Harvard courses - Wander&u=/posts/harvard-classes/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Personal opinions on Harvard courses - Wander&url=/posts/harvard-classes/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" onclick="copyLink()" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link"></i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"> <span>Recent Update</span><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/tech-internship/">Recommendations for Applying to Tech/Finance Internships</a><li><a href="/posts/harvard-classes/">Personal opinions on Harvard courses</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"> <span>Trending Tags</span><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/harvard/">harvard</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/random/">random</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/classes/">classes</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/economics/">economics</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/life/">life</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"> <span class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</span><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/why-busy/"><div class="card-body"> <span class="timeago small" > May 21 <i class="unloaded">2021-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</i> </span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Why do we Overpack our Schedules?</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> During the semester, I tried to meet up and call my friends from school.
