As someone who has gone through the process a few times, I thought it would be helpful to write down my thoughts. I will use “tech” to describe anything that attracts Math/CS students, which often includes finance as well.</p><h1 id="recruiting-timeline">Recruiting Timeline</h1><p>Since many companies are recruiting for strong talents, we get a “race to the bottom”. Many companies want students to apply/interview early. Then, they can send out an offer with a tight deadline and lock the student in. As a result, big companies start recruiting in Aug-Oct and often end near Dec. Startups tend to be less certain about how many interns they can hire, and recruit more in the spring.</p><h1 id="step-1-resume-dropping">Step 1: Resume Dropping</h1><ol><li>Apply to <em>many</em> internships. Unlike college applications, quantity often matters more than quality. Whether you get an opportunity depends far more on the state of the company than on you. The advantage you get from crafting the perfect cover letter is smaller than just applying to 3-4 more places.<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships">this Github repo</a> to keep track of internship opportunities.<li>Have a standard resume. <a href="https://ocs.fas.harvard.edu/resumes-cvs-cover-letters">Harvard’s template</a> works well. Then, go to your school’s career advisors (or someone you know) to check for errors. Have a standard cover letter as well – the link above contains a template too.</ol><h2 id="career-fairs">Career Fairs</h2><p>These can feel a little daunting. However, they can be more fun than stressful. Consider going to career fairs, not with the goal of talking to recruiters, but with the goal of getting swag. Just keep dropping resume and picking up swag. Bring a dufflebag – you will need it. That being said, I encourage you to only pick up swags that you want / are cool. Otherwise, this is quite wasteful.</p><p>You may see people talking to recruiter for a long time and feel intimidated. You don’t need to do that. The recruiter would have forgotten the conversation 10 minutes later.</p><h2 id="coffee-chats">Coffee Chats</h2><p>If you want to talk to a recruiter, <em>coffee chats</em> are the way to go. These are longer (often 30 min) times where you get to learn about the company and talk about yourself. You get to build a stronger connection with the recruiters, which may lead to an interview. The coffee and snacks are also incredibly good.</p><h2 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is useful for displaying yourself and for finding people who worked at a certain company. To gauge what to put on your linkedin, the easiest way is to look at your peers and see what they have.</p><p>If you want to learn more about a specific company, consider searching for it on LinkedIn. You may find someone you know or share a connection with, which may lead to an informational conversation. This is also useful for the interview steps below: knowing a company helps you understand what they are looking for.</p><h2 id="referrals">Referrals</h2><p>Referrals can be confusing, but they are essentially <em>a way for the referrer to vouch for your excellence</em>. The referrer may be a past intern/full timer at the company. When they send a referral, it usually means “I have worked with this person and thought they would be a good fit as well”.</p><p>If I want a referral, I would usually reach out to friends / classmates who worked there and ask to talk about their experience. Then, I would ask if they can give me a referral. At the same time, I am not surprised if a classmate says no to such a request. <em>Referrals should be treated seriously</em>: haphazard referrals may reflect poorly on the referrer. This can also apply to people you find on LinkedIn, though you should be aiming more for information than a referral.</p><h1 id="step-2-hrbehavioral-interviews">Step 2: HR/Behavioral Interviews</h1><p>After many rejection emails and ghosts, you get to the first round of screening. This is often the HR/behavioral round, where they will ask you the standard questions like “tell me about yourself” and “what are your biggest strengths and weaknesses”.</p><ol><li>Use the STAR (setup, task, action, result) format. You can learn about it <a href="https://hwpi.harvard.edu/files/ocs/files/interviewing_1.pdf">here</a>.<li>Practice the <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/common-interview-questions-and-answers">standard questions</a> with an adviser or a friend.<li>Always prepare some questions. Lean on asking light questions instead of loaded ones: What do you do for fun? Favorite memory from working here? What do you look forward to on your job? Try to make your interviewer’s day a little better.</ol><h1 id="step-3-technical-interviews">Step 3: Technical Interviews</h1><p>This step has the least amount of variance out of all the steps. If you come prepared, it is hard to fail this step.</p><h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2><p>For SWE (software engineer) roles, the interviews tend to ask intro algorithms problems. To prepare, consider doing the following:</p><ol><li>Solve company-specific interview problems by looking on Glassdoor.<li>Solve problems on <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>.<li>Solve problems on Leetcode. Too often the company just presents a leetcode style problem.</ol><p>Also, many CS competitions (e.g. Codeforces) give problems that are essentially harder versions of interview questions. They can be a fun way to practice for the interviews.</p><p>For quant finance roles, expect to see more probability and statistics. You should still solve company-specific interview problems. An intro probability course, such as Stat 110 at Harvard, can also be helpful.</p><h2 id="the-interview">The Interview</h2><p>To do well in technical interviews, <strong>say what you are thinking out loud</strong> and <strong>ask questions</strong>. If you are not used to this, practice before the interview.</p><p>Why do this? Consider the problem difficulty:</p><ol><li>The problem is straightforward. Compared to saying the answer in the end, you want to show how you crushed the problem.<li>The problem is somewhat difficult. If you talk through the process, you can get a few hints from the interviewer and solve the problem.<li>The problem is extremely hard. Compared to sitting there and doing nothing, you want to describe what you tried and show that you know different ieas.</ol><h1 id="step-4-offers-and-decisions">Step 4: Offers and Decisions</h1><p>You landed the job, it’s now time to make decisions! Internship experiences can differ widely between big tech, tech startups, finance, and others. Try to get as much <em>information</em> about these places as possible. Ask classmates, friends, and other people who have worked there. You can also email people from the interview process. You got the offer – this is the time to ask questions.</p><p>Note how I said <em>information</em>, not <em>suggestions</em>. Most people do not know you well, so their suggestions tend to apply more to themselves than to you. If you want sugestions, consider asking people who you sincerely trust.</p><p>If the offer comes with a tight deadline and you are strongly considering it, you should email every company you are interviewing about this. They can often expedite the process and get you an interview result quickly.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/harvard/'>Harvard</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/harvard/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >harvard</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Recommendations for Applying to Tech/Finance Internships - Wander&url=/posts/tech-internship/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Recommendations for Applying to Tech/Finance Internships - Wander&u=/posts/tech-internship/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Recommendations for Applying to Tech/Finance Internships - Wander&url=/posts/tech-internship/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" onclick="copyLink()" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link"></i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"> <span>Recent Update</span><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/tech-internship/">Recommendations for Applying to Tech/Finance Internships</a><li><a href="/posts/harvard-classes/">Personal opinions on Harvard courses</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"> <span>Trending Tags</span><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/harvard/">harvard</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/random/">random</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/classes/">classes</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/economics/">economics</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/life/">life</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"> <span class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</span><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/why-busy/"><div class="card-body"> <span class="timeago small" > May 21 <i class="unloaded">2021-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</i> </span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Why do we Overpack our Schedules?</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> During the semester, I tried to meet up and call my friends from school.
