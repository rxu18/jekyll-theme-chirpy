**tl;dr**: New writings about academics, coming out every Tuesday / Thursday / Saturday, until I don't have interesting things to talk about.

I have not been writing enough in the past few semesters.

Perhaps this is because I was busy, or because I didn't value writing at the time. Nevertheless, I have not written reflections on the work I do for a while now. As I start my senior fall, I am beginning to realize two benefits of writing that has made me want to do it more.

First, it helps me find motivation for the work I do. I get my motivation from being able to share the work I do with other people. So, if I can publish my writings here, I suspect I would be more motivated to produce them.

Second, it helps me organize my thoughts. I have learned about many complex ideas during my time at college. They did not feel so clear at the time, but I think there are many insights I can find by looking back at my classes. This can also help with my current classes: as I write about what I am learning, perhaps I will find more clarity in the material in those classes.

I plan to publish a new post 3 times a week, with posts falling mainly in the following three categories:

## Talks I gave / am giving on campus
I am fortunate enough to be in an educational role for many campus activities. I currently TA CS 127 and 136, help with the Crimson and HFAC comp, and can sign up to give more talks through the math and CS departments. I am quite proud of the talks I gave, and it would be a waste if these talks fade away without any written notes.

To start, I will be writing recaps for some previous talks:
* The fruits talk, from Fall 2020,
* The traveling salesman talk, from Fall 2020,
* The prediction markets talk, from Spring 2021,
* The market making talk, from Spring/Fall 2021,
* The nerd-sniping talk, from Fall 2021.

From there, I will be publishing notes as I give future talks. For example, I am going to teach 3 new CS 127 sections. After each, I will publish scribe notes here!

## Summary & Reflection on psat courses

Summary of classes I have taken in the past. For example, a summary of Deontology as described in Justice, an exploration of complex analysis as taught in Math 55b / 219, or notes in literary analysis as described in English 131P.

## Research Updates from my Thesis Process
I am currently in the thesis writing process, which involves a lot of reading in modern math research. This blog might be a little more technical than the rest, but I will try to make them approachable for someone with experiences in undergraduate mathematics.

Hope you will enjoy the writings!
